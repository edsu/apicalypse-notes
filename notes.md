## What I'm Not Saying

Chris Anderson (Wired not Ted Talk guy) 2008) End of Theory: How the Data
Deluge Makes Scientific Theory Obsolete

> This is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace
every other tool that might be brought to bear. Out with every theory of human
behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and
psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and
we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the
numbers speak for themselves...

We see this evidenced in Shoshanna Zuboff's idea of Epistemic Coup
(Surveillance Capitalism).

The top 10% of tweeters are responsible for 80% of the tweets created by all
U.S. adults on Twitter.

This data can provide a window in to viewing how these platforms function.

## Apicalypse

Axel Bruns (2019). After the APIcalypse. Information, Communication & Society.

2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, where a psychology professor at Univ of
Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan.

Subsequent changes to rate limits on the Instagram API, changes to FB's pages,
groups and events APIs.

Crackdown on third party applications such as Netvizz Digital Methods
Initiative at the University of Amsterdam. Twitter also put more barriers in
place for registering third part applications. Demise of Texifter.

"it is also a convenient step towards disabling and evading unwanted inde-
pendent, critical, public-interest scholarly scrutiny." Bruns (2019)

Twitter data grants: 6/1300 applications, owned IP

SocialScienceOne: Gary King (Harvard) and Nathaniel Persily (Stanford) ; led to 

* Deen
* platform observability  

* user profiling, spam, abuse, hate speech, trolling, extreme polarization

## DocNow

* Ferguson: 13M tweets
* Rashawn and Brown (2016)
* twarc, catalog, hydrator, docnow
* computational social scientists

## Twitter v2

* Retiring premium access. Taking a much more hands on approach to managing 3rd party services.
* Academic Research product track.
* collection volume changes
* historical data
* stream is no longer rate limited: 80 requests/second
* Twitter as gatekeeper of what counts as "research"
* role of consenst

## twarc demo

* historical search
* Point out the affordances of twarc, running on a raspberry pi

## DocNow Whitepaper?
